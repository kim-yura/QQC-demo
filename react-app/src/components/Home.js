                    Welcome to the home of the Quiet Queers Craftalong, an annual Pride-themed make-along hosted by <a className='body-link' href='https://www.instagram.com/knitboop/' rel='noreferrer' target='_blank'>knitboop</a>!

                    QQC was originally conceived of in 2019 as a response to two main concerns about Pride:
                    <br />
                    1. The corporate-washing of Pride and queer culture; and
                    <br />
                    2. The inaccessibility of some Pride events, which (in the US) mostly hinge around being outdoors, loud, and unfriendly to the needs of disabled and neurodiverse queers/allies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This craft-along aims to address these concerns by giving queer crafters and allies a (virtual) place to come together, support other queer designers and indie dyers, and win some fabulous prizes while theyâ€™re at it!
